PYNQ Peripherals
****************

PYNQ peripherals is an additional PYNQ package that supports a range of Pmod, Grove, Arduino and Raspberry Pi peripherals including inputs (buttons, switches, sensors, ADCs), outputs (lights, actuators, motors, displays, DACs), user I/O (including RF/wireless) and more. 

The PYNQ peripherals package is pre-installed on some PYNQ board. Check the Jupyter home area for your board and look for the pynq_peripherals folder to check if the package is already installed. You can find example notebooks showing how to use peripherals and some application examples. 

If you need to install the package for your board or would like to learn more, you can find details in the `PYNQ peripherals GitHub repository <https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ_Peripherals>`_
